# Network_port_scanner
This project scans a target system to identify open, closed, and filtered network ports. It helps detect active services running on a machine and highlights potential security risks caused by unnecessary or exposed ports. The tool supports basic TCP scanning and is useful for network monitoring and security assessment.
